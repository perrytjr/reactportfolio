  aboutPara: "I recently left my 6 year Hospitatlity Management career and started a 6 month Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at UC San Diego. My education consists of a Bachelors degree in Psychology and almost an entire second Bachelors degree in Teacher Education! Being a life long learner is very important to me. Better yet, I am now able to share all of my coding progress and accomplishments with you."
